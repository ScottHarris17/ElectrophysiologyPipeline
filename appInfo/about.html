    <div class="About">
    <h3><u>About</u></h3>
    <p>The physiology analysis pipeline is built to organize and analyze data from retinal electrophysiology experiments, including patch-clamp recordings. The system is designed to deal with data recorded using <a href="https://symphony-das.github.io/" target="_blank">Symphony-DAS V2.X.X.X</a> and <a href="http://stage-vss.github.io/" target="_blank">Stage V2.X.X.X</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The pipeline performs analyses on data from single cells. Batch analyses are not included, but should be straightforward to perform after having used this system to organize single cell data.</p>

    <div class="requirements">
        <h3><u>Requirements</u></h3>
        <p>The following software must be installed on your device in order to run the pipeline:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://mathworks.com" target="_blank">MATLAB 2020+</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: Clarinet is no longer required as of V1.2.0</em></p>
        <p>Run the pipeline by adding its directory system to your MATLAB path and typing the command <code style="background-color: #e3e3e3; border:thin">>>physiologyPipeline</code> into the MATLAB command window. The pipeline will run on any operating system.</p>
