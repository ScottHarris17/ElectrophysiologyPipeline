# ElectrophysiologyPipeline
Fully automated analysis pipeline for electrophysiology data.

<u>Requirements</u>
<ul>
  <li>MATLAB 2020a+</li>
  <li>Windows, Linux, or macOS</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
This pipeline is designed for electrophysiology data acquired using <a href = "https://symphony-das.github.io/">Symphony Data Acquisition software </a>. It is used to analyze raw timeseries (as they come off of an amplifier) to extract meaningful neurophysiological signatures and visualize data. Compatible data types include voltage clamp, current clamp, and cell-attached/extracellular data. To use, download the repository onto your local device, and follow the instructions in the appInfo/instructions.html file. For questions, contact <a href="mailto:scott.harris@ucsf.edu">scott.harris@ucsf.edu</a>, or the Dunn Lab at UCSF.</p>

<h4>Use</h4>
<p>To use, download this repository onto your computer and place it on your matlab path. Enter <code>physiologyPipeline</code> into the MATLAB command window. A small GUI should open. You can find complete usage instructions by selecting Info-->Instructions from the menubar. You can also find instructions in the repository by opening /appInfo/instructions.html.</p>
