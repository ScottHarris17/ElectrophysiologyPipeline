# ElectrophysiologyPipeline
Fully automated analysis pipeline for electrophysiology data.

<u>Requirements</u>
<ul>
  <li>MATLAB 2020a+</li>
<li><a href = "https://lucadellasantina.github.io/Clarinet/">Clarinet</a> installed on matlab</li>
<li>Windows, Linux, or iOS</li>

<u>Description</u>
This pipeline is designed for electrophysiology data acquired using <a href = "https://symphony-das.github.io/">Symphony Data Acquisition software </a>. It is used to analyze raw timeseries (as they come off of an amplifier) to extract meaningful neurophysiological signatures. Compatible data types include voltage clamp, current clamp, and cell-attached/extracellular data. To use, download the repository onto your local device, and follow the instructions in the appInfo/instructions.html file. For questions, contact <a href="mailto:scott.harris@ucsf.edu">scott.harris@ucsf.edu</a>, or the Dunn Lab at UCSF.
